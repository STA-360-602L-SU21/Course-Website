\section{Course Overview}
Bayesian methods are increasingly important in both industry and academia. This is a graduate course that introduces students to the basics of Bayesian inference and provides students with the tools needed to fit Bayesian models.

In this course, you will learn the importance of Bayesian methods and inference. You will be introduced to Bayesian theory, with particular emphasis on conceptual foundations as well as implementation and model fitting. You will learn the essential distinctions between classical and Bayesian methods and become familiar with the origins of Bayesian inference. You will also learn about conjugate families of distributions and why they are very convenient, and how to conduct Bayesian inference with intractable posterior distributions,  when you do not have conjugate distributions.

Although this course emphasizes the mathematical theory behind Bayesian inference, data analysis and interpretation of results are also important components. Students who wish to explore the mathematical theory in more detail than what is covered in class are welcome to engage with and request further reading materials from the instructor. Also, all students must have the theoretical background covered in the prerequisites to be able to keep up with and understand the materials. 


\section{Course Format}
This is primarily an asynchronous online course, so that students are able to participate according to their own schedule (for the most part). That said, the course is designed to align with the standard six-week Term I schedule of the summer school calendar. Therefore, there will be set deadlines to ensure that all course materials and assessments are completed in six weeks.

\subsection{Asynchronous Activities}
There will be pre-recorded lecture videos on Zoom (via Sakai), so that students can watch them and also do the pre-assigned readings according to their own schedule.  However, students will also need to attend one-hour Zoom discussion sessions every day or watch the recorded versions, to stay on top of the materials.  Students can also do the problem sets at their own time but within a one-week window from when they are posted on the website.

\subsection{Synchronous Activities}
There are no "fully synchronous" activities for the course. There will be two live lab sessions on Zoom (to be held by the TAs) per week, for students who wish to attend but recordings will be made available afterwards for students who prefer not to. Lab exercises must be turned in usually within a 48 hour window from when they are handed out. There will be two quizzes, both timed and online. Students will be able to take each quiz, and the midterm exam, within a 24-hour window. Finally, there will be a final exam, which students will be able to take within a 48-hour window. 

Additional live sessions include office hours for the instructor and TAs. The exact times will be decided based on a class survey on the availability of students. Students who are unable to attend will be allowed to send in their questions in advance, so that the instructor or TAs can provide answers during the recorded discussion sessions.

\section{Learning Objectives}
By the end of this course, students should be able to
\begin{itemize}[label= {\color{darkblue}{\ArrowBoldRightStrobe}}]
	\item Understand the basics of Bayesian inference, that is, be able to define likelihood functions, prior distributions, posterior distributions, prior predictive distributions and posterior predictive distributions.
	\item Derive posterior distributions, prior predictive distributions and posterior predictive distributions, for common likelihood-prior combinations of distributions.
	\item Interpret the results of fitted models and conduct checks to ascertain that the models have converged.
	\item Use the Bayesian methods and models covered in class to analyze real data sets.
	\item Assess the adequacy of Bayesian models to any given data and make a decision on what to do in cases when certain models are not appropriate for a given data set.
\end{itemize}


\section{Prerequisites}
ALL students are expected to be familiar with all the topics covered within the required prerequisites to be in this course. That is, STA 611 or the following: STA 210 and (STA 230 or 240L) and (MATH 202, 202D, 212, or 222) and (MATH 216, 218, or 221, any of which may be taken concurrently). Students are also expected to be very familiar with \textsf{R} and are encouraged to have learned \LaTeX \ or a Markdown language by the end of the course.


\section{Class Materials}
Lecture notes and slides, lab exercises and assigned readings will be posted on the course website, while lecture and lab videos will be posted on Sakai. White boards will also be used frequently in the lecture videos, so please pay special attention to those. Finally, we will closely follow the main textbook so students should make sure to always read the corresponding textbook chapters in the assigned readings.

\section{Workload}
You are expected to put in approximately 18-25 hours of work per week. %if you are enrolled in STA 360 and 18-25 hours of work per week if you are enrolled in STA 602, depending on your level of comfort with the topics covered in the prerequisites. 
The work hours will include time spent going through the preassigned readings, watching the lecture videos, watching or attending the lab sessions, and doing all graded work. Please note that the more focused and engaged you are, the quicker you will be able to get through all the materials.

\section{Graded Work} 
Graded work for the course will consist of problem sets, lab exercises, two quizzes, a midterm exam and a final exam. \textbf{Please note that most of the problem sets and lab exercises assigned to students enrolled in STA 602 will contain at least one question more than those assigned to students enrolled in STA 360. }

Regrade requests for problem sets and lab exercises must be done via Gradescope AT MOST \textbf{48 hours} after grades are released! Regrade requests for quizzes, midterm, and final exams must be done via Gradescope AT MOST \textbf{12 hours} after grades are released!
\begin{itemize}[label= {\color{darkblue}{\ArrowBoldRightStrobe}}]
	\item There are no make-ups for any of the graded work except for medical or familial emergencies or for reasons approved by the instructor BEFORE the due date. Contact the instructor in advance of relevant due dates to discuss possible alternatives. 
	
	\item Students' final grades will be determined as follows:
	\begin{table}[h]
		\centering
		\begin{tabular}{ll}
			Component & Percentage \\ 
			\hline
			Final Exam & 25\% \\ 
			Midterm & 20\% \\
			Problem Sets & 20\% \\
			Quiz I & 10\% \\
			Quiz II & 10\% \\
			Lab exercises & 10\% \\
			Participation Quizzes & 5\% \\
			\hline 
		\end{tabular}
	\end{table}

	\item Grades $\underline{may}$ be curved at the end of the semester. Cumulative averages of 90\% -- 100\% are guaranteed at least an A-, 80\% -- 89\% at least a B-, and 70\% -- 79\% at least a C-, however the exact ranges for letter grades will be determined after the final exam. 
	
	\textbf{If grades are curved, grades for students in STA 360 will be curved differently in comparison to the grades for students in STA 602.}
	
\end{itemize}


\section{Descriptions of graded work}
\subsection{Problem sets and lab exercises}
There will be five problem sets which will be handed out on a weekly basis. They will be based on all topics covered in the lecture videos and assigned readings will often be posted on the website every Monday, so please check the website regularly! \textbf{Also, please note that any work that is not legible by the instructor or TAs will not be graded (given a score  of 0). Every write-up must be clearly written in full sentences and clear English. Any assignment that is completely unclear to the instructors and/or TAs, may result in a grade of a 0.} For programming exercises, you are required to use R and you must submit ALL of the code as an appendix.  

Each student MUST write up and turn in her or his own answers. You are encouraged to talk to each other, regarding problem sets or to the instructor/TA. However, the write-up, solutions, and code must be entirely your own work. The assignments must be submitted on Gradescope under ``Assignments''. Note that you will not be able to make online submissions after the due date, so be sure to submit before or by the Gradescope-specified deadline.

Solutions to the problem sets will be curated from student solutions with proper attribution. Every week the TAs will select a representative correct solution for the assigned problems and put them together into one solution set with each answer being attributed to the student who wrote it. \textbf{If you would like to OPT OUT of having your solutions used for as a representative solution, please let the Instructor and TAs know in advance.}

\textbf{Finally, your lowest score on the problem sets will be dropped!}

\subsection{Lab exercises}
The objective of the lab assignments is to give you more hands-on experience with Bayesian data analysis. Join the live session or watch the recorded videos and learn a concept or two and some R from the TAs, and then work on the computational part of the problem sets. Each lab assignment should be submitted in timely fashion. You are REQUIRED to use R Markdown to type up your lab reports.

\subsection{Quizzes}
There will be two quizzes, both timed and online. Students will be able to take the quiz within a 24-hour window. Detailed instructions on the quizzes will be made available later.

\subsection{Midterm Exam}
Students will be able to take the midterm within a 24-hour window.  Soon after the midterm, you will be given a midterm grade assessing your overall performance. Note that the main purpose of this is to let you know how you are doing in the class. Detailed instructions on the midterm will be made available later.

\subsection{Final Exam}
There will be a final exam, which you will be able to take within a 48-hour window. If you miss any quiz or the midterm, your grade will depend more on the final exam score since there are no make-up exams. You cannot miss the final exam! Detailed instructions on the final will be made available later.


\section{Late Submission Policy} 
\begin{itemize}
	\item You will lose
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item 25\% of the total points on each problem set if you submit within the first 24 hours after it is due, 
		\item 50\% of the total points if you submit within the first 48 hours after it is due, and
		\item 100\% of the total points if you submit later than that.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	In addition, you will lose 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item 50\% of the total points on each lab exercise if you submit within the first 24 hours after it is due, and
		\item 100\% of the total points if you submit later than that.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\item You will lose 100\% of the total points on quizzes, midterms and final exams if you miss the dates/times.
\end{itemize}


\section{Auditing}
Students who audit this course will be expected to complete most of the graded work with the goal of getting an overall score of at least 70\%; you will only need to complete enough graded work to get to 70\%. You are also expected to watch the videos, go through the readings, and generally, participate like everyone else. You must contact the instructor in advance if you wish to audit the course.
