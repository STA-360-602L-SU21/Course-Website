## Count data

- We will use the Metropolis sampler on count data with predictors, so let's first do some general review.

--

- Suppose you have count data as your response variable. 

--

- For example, we may want to explain the number of c-sections carried out in hospitals using potential predictors such as hospital type, (that is, private vs public), location, size of the hospital, etc.

--

- The models we have covered so far are not (completely) adequate for count data with predictors.

--

- Of course there are instances where linear regression, with some transformations (especially taking logs) on the response variable, might still work reasonably well for count data.

--

- That's not the focus here, so we won't cover that.



---
## Poisson regression

- As we have seen so far, a good distribution for modeling count data with no limit on the total number of counts is the .hlight[Poisson distribution].

--

- As a reminder, the Poisson pmf is given by
.block[
.small[
$$\Pr[Y = y | \lambda] = \dfrac{\lambda^y e^{-\lambda}}{y!}; \ \ \ \ y=0,1,2,\ldots; \ \ \ \ \lambda > 0.$$
]
]

--

- Remember that
.block[
.small[
$$\mathbb{E}[Y = y] = \mathbb{V}[Y = y] = \lambda.$$
]
]


--

- When our data fails this assumption, we may have what is known as .hlight[over-dispersion] and may want to consider the [Negative Binomial distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_binomial_distribution) instead (actually easy to fit within the Bayesian framework!).
  
--

- With predictors, index $\lambda$ with $i$, so that each $\lambda_i$ is a function of $\boldsymbol{X}$. Therefore, the .hlight[random component] of the glm is
.block[
.small[
$$p(y_i | \lambda_i) = \textrm{Poisson}(\lambda_i); \ \ \ i=1,\ldots,n. $$
]
]


---
## Poisson regression

- We must ensure that $\lambda_i > 0$ at any value of $\boldsymbol{X}$, therefore, we need a .hlight[link function] that enforces this. A natural choice is
.block[
$$\textrm{log}\left(\lambda_i\right) = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} x_{i1} + \beta_{2} x_{i2} + \ldots + \beta_{p} x_{ip}.$$
]

--

- Combining these pieces give us our full mathematical representation for the .hlight[Poisson regression].

--

- Clearly, $\lambda_i$ has a natural interpretation as the "expected count", and
.block[
$$\lambda_i = e^{\beta_{0} + \beta_{1} x_{i1} + \beta_{2} x_{i2} + \ldots + \beta_{p} x_{ip}}$$
]

  so the $e^{\beta_{j}}$'s are .hlight[multiplicative effects] on the expected counts.
  
--

- For the frequentist version, in .hlight[R], use the `glm` command but set the option `family = “poisson”`.

## Analysis of horseshoe crabs

- We have data from a study of nesting horseshoe crabs (J. Brockmann, Ethology, 102: 1–21, 1996). The data has been discussed in Agresti (2002).

--

- Each female horseshoe crab in the study had a male crab attached to her in her nest.

--

- The study investigated factors that affect whether the female crab had any other males, called satellites, residing nearby her.

--

- The response outcome for each female crab is her number of satellites.

--

- We have several factors (including the female crab's color, spine condition, weight, and carapace width) which may influence the presence/absence of satellite males.

--

- The data is called `hcrabs` in the R package `rsq`.



---
## Analysis of horseshoe crabs

- Let's fit the Poisson regression model to the data. In vector form, we have
.block[
.small[
$$
\begin{split}
y_i & \sim \textrm{Poisson}(\lambda_i); \ \ \ i=1,\ldots,n;\\ 
\\
\text{log}[\lambda_i] & = \boldsymbol{\beta}^T \boldsymbol{x}_i
\end{split}
$$
]
]

  where $y_i$ is the number of satellites for female crab $i$, and $\boldsymbol{x}_i$ contains the intercept and female crab $i$'s
  + color;
  + spine condition;
  + weight; and
  + carapace width.
  
--

- Suppose we specify a normal prior for $\boldsymbol{\beta} = (\beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_2, \ldots, \beta_{p-1})$, $\pi(\boldsymbol{\beta}) = \mathcal{N}_p(\boldsymbol{\beta}_0, \Sigma_0)$.

--

- Can you write down the posterior for $\boldsymbol{\beta}$? Can you sample directly from it?



---
## Analysis of horseshoe crabs

- We can use Metropolis to generate samples from the posterior.

--

- First, we need a "symmetric" proposal density $\boldsymbol{\beta}^\star \sim g[\boldsymbol{\beta}^\star | \boldsymbol{\beta}^{(s)}]$; a reasonable choice is usually a multivariate normal centered on $\boldsymbol{\beta}^{(s)}$.

--

- What about the variance of the proposal density? We can use the variance of the ols estimate, that is, $\hat{\sigma}^2 \left(\boldsymbol{X}^T \boldsymbol{X}\right)^{-1}$, which we can scale using $\delta$, to tune the acceptance ratio.

--

- Here, $\hat{\sigma}^2$ is calculated as the sample variance of $\textrm{log}[y_i + c]$, for some small constant $c$, to avoid problems when $y_i = 0$.

--

- So we have $g[\boldsymbol{\beta}^\star | \boldsymbol{\beta}^{(s)}] = \mathcal{N}_p\left(\boldsymbol{\beta}^{(s)}, \delta \hat{\sigma}^2 \left(\boldsymbol{X}^T \boldsymbol{X}\right)^{-1} \right)$.

--

- Finally, since we do not have any information apriori about $\boldsymbol{\beta}$, let's set the prior for it to be $\pi(\boldsymbol{\beta}) = \mathcal{N}_p(\boldsymbol{\beta}_0 = \boldsymbol{0}, \Sigma_0 = \boldsymbol{I})$.


  
---
## Analysis of horseshoe crabs

- The Metropolis algorithm for this model is:

  1. Given a current $\boldsymbol{\beta}^{(s)}$, generate a _candidate_ value $\boldsymbol{\beta}^\star \sim g[\boldsymbol{\beta}^\star | \boldsymbol{\beta}^{(s)}] = \mathcal{N}_p\left(\boldsymbol{\beta}^{(s)}, \delta \hat{\sigma}^2 \left(\boldsymbol{X}^T \boldsymbol{X}\right)^{-1} \right)$.
  
--

  2. Compute the acceptance ratio
  .block[
.small[
$$
\begin{split}
r & = \dfrac{\pi(\boldsymbol{\beta}^\star | Y)}{\pi(\boldsymbol{\beta}^{(s)} | Y)} = \dfrac{\pi(\boldsymbol{\beta}^\star) \cdot p(Y | \boldsymbol{\beta}^\star)}{\pi(\boldsymbol{\beta}^{(s)}) \cdot p(Y | \boldsymbol{\beta}^{(s)})}\\
\\
& = \dfrac{ \mathcal{N}_p(\boldsymbol{\beta}^\star | \boldsymbol{\beta}_0 = \boldsymbol{0}, \Sigma_0 = \boldsymbol{I}) \cdot \prod\limits^n_{i=1} \text{Poisson}\left(Y_i| \lambda_i = \text{exp}\left\{  \left(\boldsymbol{\beta}^\star \right)^T \boldsymbol{x}_i \right\} \right) }{ \mathcal{N}_p(\boldsymbol{\beta}^{(s)} | \boldsymbol{\beta}_0 = \boldsymbol{0}, \Sigma_0 = \boldsymbol{I}) \cdot \prod\limits^n_{i=1} \text{Poisson}\left(Y_i| \lambda_i = \text{exp}\left\{  \left(\boldsymbol{\beta}^{(s)} \right)^T \boldsymbol{x}_i \right\} \right) }.
\end{split}
$$
]
]

--

  3. Sample $u \sim U(0,1)$ and set
  .block[
.small[
\begin{eqnarray*}
\boldsymbol{\beta}^{(s+1)} = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
\boldsymbol{\beta}^\star & \quad \text{if} \quad u < r \\
\boldsymbol{\beta}^{(s)} & \quad \text{if} \quad \text{otherwise} \\
\end{array} \right. .
\end{eqnarray*}
]
]
