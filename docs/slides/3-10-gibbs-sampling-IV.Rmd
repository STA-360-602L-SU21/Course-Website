## Some MCMC terminology

- .hlight[Convergence]: bypassing initial drift in the samples towards a stationary distribution.

--

- .hlight[Burn-in]: samples at start of the chain that are discarded to allow convergence.

--

- .hlight[Trace plot]: plot of sampled values of a parameter vs iterations.

--

- .hlight[Slow mixing]: tendency for high autocorrelation in the samples.

--

- .hlight[Thinning]: practice of collecting every $k$th iteration to reduce autocorrelation.

  It gets you a little closer to iid draws and saves memory (you don't store all draws), but unless memory is a major issue or autocorrelation is very high, thinning is usually not needed.



---
## Burn-in

- Because convergence often occurs regardless of our starting point (in not-too-complex problems at least), we can usually pick any reasonable values in the parameter space as a starting point.

--

- The time it takes for the chain to converge may vary depending on how close the starting values are to a high probability region of the posterior.

--

- Generally, we throw out a certain number of the first draws, known as the **burn-in**, as an attempt to make our draws closer to the
stationary distribution and less dependent on any single set of starting values. 

--

- However, we don't know exactly when convergence occurs, so it is not always clear how much burn-in we would need.




---
## Trace plot with bad mixing

- .hlight[Trace plot]: plot of sampled values of a parameter vs iterations.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height="450px",out.width="550px"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/traceplot_bad.png")
```



---
## Poor mixing

- Exhibits "snaking" behavior in trace plot with cyclic local trends in the mean.

--

- Poor mixing in the Gibbs sampler caused by high posterior correlation in the parameters.

--

- Decreases efficiency & many more samples need to be collected to maintain low Monte Carlo error in posterior summaries.

--

- For very poor mixing chain, may even need millions of iterations.

--

- Routinely examine trace plots!



---
## Trace plot with good mixing

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height="500px",out.width="550px"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/traceplot_good.png")
```



---
## Convergence diagnostics

- Diagnostics available to help decide on number of burn-in & collected samples.

--

- **Note**: no definitive tests of convergence but you should do as many diagnostics as you can, on all parameters in your model.

--

- With "experience", visual inspection of trace plots perhaps most useful approach.

--

- There are a number of useful automated tests in R.



---
## Diagnostics in R

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
y <- c(20,10,19,15,9,18) #data
y_bar <- mean(y); s2 <- var(y); n <- length(y) #sample statistics you'll need

S <- 10000 # number of samples to draw

PHI <- matrix(nrow=S,ncol=3); #matrix to save results
colnames(PHI) <- c("mu","tau","sigma2") 
PHI[1,] <- phi <- c(y_bar,1/s2,s2) #starting values are MLEs

mu0 <- 0; sigma02 <- 100; nu0 <- 1; tau0 <- 1/100 #hyperparameters


###### Gibbs sampler ######
set.seed(1234) #to replicate results exactly
for(s in 2:S) {
#first, draw new mu
taun <- 1/sigma02 + n*phi[2]
mun <- (mu0/sigma02 + n*y_bar*phi[2])/taun
phi[1] <- rnorm(1,mun,sqrt(1/taun))

#now, draw new tau/sigma2
nun <- nu0+n
#trick to speed up calculation of sum(y_i-\mu)^2
s2nmu <- (nu0/tau0 + (n-1)*s2 + n*(y_bar-phi[1])^2)/nun
phi[2] <- rgamma(1,nun/2,nun*s2nmu/2)
phi[3] <- 1/phi[2] #save sigma2

#save the current joint draws
PHI[s,] <- phi
}
###### End of Gibbs sampler ######
```


- The most popular package for MCMC diagnostics in R is `coda`.

--

- `coda` uses a special MCMC format so you must always convert your posterior matrix into an MCMC object. 

--

- Continuing with the posterior samples for the Pygmalion study, we have the following in R.
  ```{r fig.height=4}
#library(coda)
phi.mcmc <- mcmc(PHI,start=1) #no burn-in (simple problem!)
```



---
## Diagnostics in R

```{r fig.height=4}
summary(phi.mcmc)
```

The naive SE is the **standard error of the mean**, which captures simulation error of the mean rather than the posterior uncertainty. 

The time-series SE adjusts the naive SE for **autocorrelation**.



---
## Effective sample size

- The .hlight[effective sample size] translates the number of MCMC samples $S$ into an equivalent number of independent samples.

--

- It is defined as
.block[
.small[
$$\textrm{ESS} = \dfrac{S}{1 + 2 \sum_k \rho_k},$$
]
]

  where $S$ is the sample size and $\rho_k$ is the lag $k$ autocorrelation.
  
--

- For our data, we have
  ```{r fig.height=4}
effectiveSize(phi.mcmc)
```

--

- So our 10,000 samples are equivalent to 7452 independent samples for $\mu$, 7878 independent samples for $\tau$, and 6713 independent samples for $\sigma^2$.




---
## Trace plot for mean

```{r fig.height=3.9}
plot(phi.mcmc[,"mu"])
```

Looks great!



---
## Trace plot for precision

```{r fig.height=3.9}
plot(phi.mcmc[,"tau"])
```

Looks great!



---
## Trace plot for variance

```{r fig.height=3.7}
plot(phi.mcmc[,"sigma2"])
```

We do see a few wacky samples that we did not see with $\tau$, due to the scale. Generally, still looks great!



---
## Autocorrelation

- Another way to evaluate convergence is to look at the autocorrelation between draws of our Markov chain.

--

- The lag $k$ autocorrelation, $\rho_k$, is the correlation between each draw and its $k$th lag, defined as
.block[
.small[
$$\rho_k = \dfrac{\sum_{s=1}^{S-k}(\theta_s - \bar{\theta})(\theta_{s+k} - \bar{\theta})}{\sum_{s=1}^{S-k}(\theta_s - \bar{\theta})^2}.$$
]
]

--

- We expect the autocorrelation to decrease as $k$ increases. 

--

- If autocorrelation remains high as $k$ increases, we have slow mixing due to the inability of the sampler to move around the space well.



---
## Autocorrelation for mean

```{r fig.height=3.9}
autocorr.plot(phi.mcmc[,"mu"])
```

This looks great! Look how quickly autocorrelation goes to 0.


---
## Autocorrelation for precision

```{r fig.height=3.9}
autocorr.plot(phi.mcmc[,"tau"])
```

Also great!



---
## Autocorrelation for variance

```{r fig.height=3.9}
autocorr.plot(phi.mcmc[,"sigma2"])
```

Also great!




---
## Gelman and Rubin Statistic

- Andrew Gelman and Don Rubin suggested a diagnostic statistic based on taking separate sets of Gibbs samples (multiple chains) with dispersed initial values to test convergence. 

--

- The algorithm proceeds as follows.
  + Run m > 2 chains of length 2S from overdispersed starting values.
  + Discard the first S draws in each chain.
  + Calculate the within-chain and between-chain variance.
  + Calculate the estimated variance of the parameter as a weighted sum of the within-chain and between-chain variance.
  + Calculate the potential scale reduction factor
.block[
.small[
$$\hat{R} = \sqrt{\dfrac{\hat{\textrm{Var}(\theta)}}{W}},$$
]
]

  where $\hat{\textrm{Var}(\theta)}$ is the weighted sum of the within-chain and between-chain variance and $W$ is the mean of the variances of each chain (average within-chain variance).



---
## Geweke statistic

- Geweke proposed taking two non-overlapping parts of a single Markov chain (usually the first 10% and the last 50%) and comparing the mean of both parts, using a difference of means test.

--

- The null hypothesis would be that the two parts of the chain are from the same distribution. 

--

- The test statistic is a z-score with standard errors adjusted for autocorrelation, and if the p-value is significant for a variable, you need more draws. 

--

- The output is the z-score itself (not the p-value).

```{r fig.height=4.1}
geweke.diag(phi.mcmc)
```


---
## Practical advice on diagnostics

- There are more tests we can use: Raftery and Lewis diagnostic, Heidelberger and Welch, etc.

--

- The Gelman-Rubin approach is quite appealing in using multiple chains

--

- Geweke (and Heidelberger and Welch) sometimes reject even when the trace plots look good.

--

- Overly sensitive to minor departures from stationarity that do not impact inferences.

--

- Sometimes this can be solved with more iterations. Otherwise, you may want to try multiple chains.

--

- Most common method of assessing convergence is visual examination of trace plots.

--

- **CAUTION**: diagnostics cannot guarantee that a chain has converged, but they can indicate it has not converged.

## HPD interval for Pygmalion data

```{r fig.height=4.3,message=F,warning=F,results='hide'}
#library(hdrcde)
hdr.den(PHI[,1],prob=95,main="95% HPD region", xlab=expression(mu),
        ylab=expression(paste(pi,"(", mu, "|y)")))
```



---
## HPD interval for Pygmalion data

```{r fig.height=4.3,message=F,warning=F,results='hide'}
hdr.den(PHI[,2],prob=95,main="95% HPD region", xlab=expression(tau),
        ylab=expression(paste(pi,"(", tau, "|y)")))
```



---
## HPD interval for Pygmalion data

```{r}
hdr(PHI[,1],prob=95)$hdr
hdr(PHI[,2],prob=95)$hdr
```

We can compare the HPD intervals to the equal tailed credible intervals.

```{r fig.height=4}
quantile(PHI[,1],c(0.025,0.975))
quantile(PHI[,2],c(0.025,0.975))
```

Intervals are closer for $\mu$ (symmetric density) compared to $\tau$ (not symmetric).
