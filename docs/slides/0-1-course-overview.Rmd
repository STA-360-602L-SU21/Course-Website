## FAQs

All materials and information will be posted on the course webpage:

[https://sta-360-602l-su21.github.io/Course-Website/](https://sta-360-602l-su21.github.io/Course-Website/)

--

- How much theory will this class cover? A lot! Make sure you are especially comfortable working with probability distributions.

--

- Am I prepared to take this course? Yes, if you are familiar with the topics covered in the course prerequisites.

--

- Will we be doing "very heavy" computing? Not too heavy but yes, a good amount. You will be expected to be able to write your own MCMC sampler later on.

--

- What computing language will we use? R!

--

- What if I don't know R? This course assumes you already know R but you can still learn on the fly (you must be self-motivated). Here are some resources for you: [https://sta-360-602l-su21.github.io/Course-Website/resources/](https://sta-360-602l-su21.github.io/Course-Website/resources/).

## FAQs

- What if I can't remember the topics in the prerequisites?
  1. Review Chapters 1 to 5 of the [Casella and Berger book](https://mybiostats.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/casella-berger.pdf)
  
  2. You can find the solution manual [here](http://www.ams.sunysb.edu/~zhu/ams570/Solutions-Casella-Berger.pdf)
  
  3. Focus on the following topics:
      + basic probability theory, random variables, transformations of random variables, expectations of random variables, common families of probability distribution functions including multivariate distributions
      + concepts of convergence, principles of statistical inference, likelihood based inference, sampling distributions and hypothesis testing.
