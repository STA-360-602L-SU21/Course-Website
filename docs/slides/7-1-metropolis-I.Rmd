## Introduction

- As a refresher, suppose $y = (y_1,\ldots,y_n)$ and each $y_i \sim p(y | \theta)$. Suppose we specify a prior $\pi(\theta)$ on $\theta$.

--

- Then as usual, we are interested in
.block[
.small[
$$\pi(\theta | y) = \frac{\pi(\theta)p(y,|\theta)}{\mathcal{p}(y)}.$$
]
]

--

- As we already know, it is often difficult to compute $\mathcal{p}(y)$.

--

- Using the Monte Carlo method or Gibbs sampler, we have seen that we don't need to know $p(y)$. 

--

- As long as we have conjugate and semi-conjugate priors, we can generate samples directly from $\pi(\theta | y)$.

--

- What happens if we cannot sample directly from $\pi(\theta | y)$?



---
## Motivating example

- To motivate our discussions on the Metropolis algorithm, let's explore a simple example.

--

- Suppose we wish to sample from the following density
.block[
$$
\begin{split}
\pi(\theta | y) \propto \text{exp}^{-\dfrac{1}{2}\theta^2} + \dfrac{1}{2} \text{exp}^{-\dfrac{1}{2}(\theta-3)^2}
\end{split}
$$
]

--

- This is a _mixture of two normal densities_, one with mode near 0 and the other with mode near 3.  
  
--

- _**Note**: we will cover finite mixture models properly soon_.

--

- Anyway, let's use this density to explore the main ideas behind the Metropolis sampler.

--

- <div class="question">
By the way, as you will see, we don't actually  need to know the normalizing constant for Metropolis sampling but for this example, find it for practice!
</div>




---
## Motivating example

- Let's take a look at the (normalized) density:
```{r, fig.height=4.3, echo=F}
x <- seq(from=-5,to=7,by=.05)
y <- (2/(3*sqrt(2*pi))) * (exp(-0.5*(x^2)) + 0.5*exp(-0.5*(x-3)^2))
plot(x,y,col="blue3",xlab=expression(theta),ylab="Density",
     main=expression(paste(pi,"(", theta,"|y)")))
```

--

- There are other ways of sampling from this density, but let's focus specifically on the Metropolis algorithm here.




---
## Metropolis algorithm

- From a sampling perspective, we need to have a large group of values, $\theta^{(1)}, \ldots, \theta^{(S)}$ from $\pi(\theta | y)$ whose empirical distribution approximates $\pi(\theta | y)$.

--

- That means that for any two values $a$ and $b$, we want
.block[
.small[
$$\dfrac{\# \theta^{(s)} = a}{S} \div \dfrac{\# \theta^{(s)} = b}{S} = \dfrac{\# \theta^{(s)} = a}{S} \times \dfrac{S}{\# \theta^{(s)} = b} = \dfrac{\# \theta^{(s)} = a}{\# \theta^{(s)} = b} \approx \dfrac{\pi(\theta = a | y)}{\pi(\theta = b | y)}$$
]
]

--

- Basically, we want to make sure that if $a$ and $b$ are plausible values in $\pi(\theta | y)$, the ratio of the number of the $\theta^{(1)}, \ldots, \theta^{(S)}$ values equal to them properly approximates $\dfrac{\pi(\theta = a | y)}{\pi(\theta = b | y)}$.

--

- How might we construct a group like this?



---
## Metropolis algorithm

- Suppose we have a working group $\theta^{(1)}, \ldots, \theta^{(s)}$ at iteration $s$, and need to add a new value $\theta^{(s+1)}$.

--

- Consider a candidate value $\theta^\star$ that is close to $\theta^{(s)}$ _(we will get to how to generate the candidate value in a minute)_. Should we set $\theta^{(s+1)} = \theta^\star$ or not?

--

- Well, we should probably compute $\pi(\theta^\star | y)$ and see if $\pi(\theta^\star | y) > \pi(\theta^{(s)} | y)$. Equivalently, look at $r = \dfrac{\pi(\theta^\star | y)}{\pi(\theta^{(s)} | y)}$.

--

- By the way, notice that
.block[
.small[
$$
\begin{split}
r & = \dfrac{\pi(\theta^\star | y)}{\pi(\theta^{(s)} | y)} = \dfrac{p(y | \theta^\star) \pi(\theta^\star)}{p(y)} \div \dfrac{p(y | \theta^{(s)}) \pi(\theta^{(s)})}{p(y)}\\
\\
& =  \dfrac{p(y | \theta^\star) \pi(\theta^\star)}{p(y)} \times \dfrac{p(y)}{p(y | \theta^{(s)}) \pi(\theta^{(s)})} = \dfrac{p(y | \theta^\star) \pi(\theta^\star)}{p(y | \theta^{(s)}) \pi(\theta^{(s)})},
\end{split}
$$
]
]

  which does not depend on the marginal likelihood we don't know!




---
## Metropolis algorithm

- If $r > 1$
  + Intuition: $\theta^{(s)}$ is already a part of the density we desire and the density at $\theta^\star$ is even higher than the density at $\theta^{(s)}$.
  
  + Action: set $\theta^{(s+1)} = \theta^\star$

--

- If $r < 1$, 
  + Intuition: relative frequency of values on our group $\theta^{(1)}, \ldots, \theta^{(s)}$ equal to $\theta^\star$ should be $\approx r = \dfrac{\pi(\theta^\star | y)}{\pi(\theta^{(s)} | y)}$. For every $\theta^{(s)}$, include only a fraction of an instance of $\theta^\star$.
  
  + Action: set $\theta^{(s+1)} = \theta^\star$ with probability $r$ and $\theta^{(s+1)} = \theta^{(s)}$ with probability $1-r$.



---
## Metropolis algorithm

- This is the basic intuition behind the .hlight[Metropolis algorithm].

--

- Where should the proposed value $\theta^\star$ come from? 

--

- Sample $\theta^\star$ close to the current value $\theta^{(s)}$ using a .hlight[symmetric proposal distribution] $g[\theta^\star | \theta^{(s)}]$. $g$ is actually a "family of proposal distributions", indexed by the specific value of $\theta^{(s)}$.

--

- Here, symmetric means that $g[\theta^\star | \theta^{(s)}] = g[\theta^{(s)} | \theta^\star]$. 

--

- The symmetric proposal is usually very simple with density concentrated near $\theta^{(s)}$, for example, $\mathcal{N}(\theta^\star; \theta^{(s)}, \delta^2)$ or $\text{Unif}(\theta^\star; \theta^{(s)} - \delta, \theta^{(s)} + \delta)$.

--

- After obtaining $\theta^\star$, either add it or add a copy of $\theta^{(s)}$ to our current set of values, depending on the value of $r$.



---
## Metropolis algorithm

- The algorithm proceeds as follows:

  1. Given $\theta^{(1)}, \ldots, \theta^{(s)}$, generate a _candidate_ value $\theta^\star \sim g[\theta^\star | \theta^{(s)}]$.
  
--

  2. Compute the acceptance ratio
  .block[
.small[
$$
\begin{split}
r & = \dfrac{\pi(\theta^\star | y)}{\pi(\theta^{(s)} | y)} = \dfrac{p(y | \theta^\star) \pi(\theta^\star)}{p(y | \theta^{(s)}) \pi(\theta^{(s)})}.
\end{split}
$$
]
]

--

  3. Set
  .block[
.small[
\begin{eqnarray*}
\theta^{(s+1)} = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
\theta^\star & \quad \text{with probability} \quad \text{min}(r,1) \\
\theta^{(s)} & \quad \text{with probability} \quad 1 - \text{min}(r,1) \\
\end{array} \right.
\end{eqnarray*}
]
]

      which can be accomplished by sampling $u \sim U(0,1)$ independently and setting
  .block[
.small[
\begin{eqnarray*}
\theta^{(s+1)} = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
\theta^\star & \quad \text{if} \quad u < r \\
\theta^{(s)} & \quad \text{if} \quad \text{otherwise} \\
\end{array} \right. .
\end{eqnarray*}
]
]



---
## Metropolis algorithm

- Once we obtain the samples, then we are back to using Monte Carlo approximations for quantities of interest.

--

- That is, we can again approximate posterior means, quantiles, and other quantities of interest using the empirical distribution of our sampled values.

--

- _Some notes:_
  + The Metropolis chain ALWAYS moves to the proposed $\theta^\star$ at iteration $s+1$ if $\theta^\star$ has
higher target density than the current $\theta^{(s)}$.

--

  + Sometimes, it also moves to a $\theta^\star$ value with lower density in proportion to the density value itself. 

--

  + This leads to a random, Markov process than naturally explores the space according to the probability defined by $\pi(\theta | y)$, and hence generates a sequence that, while dependent, eventually represents draws from $\pi(\theta | y)$.



---
## Metropolis algorithm: convergence

- We will not cover the convergence theory behind Metropolis chains in detail, but below are a few notes for those interested:

--

  + The Markov process generated under this condition is .hlight[ergodic] and has a limiting distribution.

--

  + Here, think of ergodicity as meaning that the chain can move anywhere at each step, which is ensured, for example, if $g[\theta^\star | \theta^{(s)}] > 0$ everywhere!

--

  + By construction, it turns out that the Metropolis chains are .hlight[reversible], so that convergence to $\pi(\theta | y)$ is assured.
  
--

  + Think of reversibility as being equivalent to symmetry of the joint density of two consecutive $\theta^{(s)}$ and $\theta^{(s+1)}$ in the stationary process, which we do have by using a symmetric proposal distribution.
  
--

- If you want to learn more about convergence of MCMC chains, consider taking one of the courses on stochastic processes, or Markov chain theory.



---
## Metropolis algorithm: tuning

- Correlation between samples can be adjusted by selecting optimal $\delta$ (i.e., spread of the distribution) in the proposal distribution

--

- Decreasing correlation increases the effective sample size, increasing rate of convergence, and improving the Monte Carlo approximation to the posterior.

--

- However, 
  + $\delta$ too small leads to $r \approx 1$ for most proposed values, a high acceptance rate, but very small moves, leading to highly correlated chain.
  + $\delta$ too large can get "stuck" at the posterior mode(s) because $\theta^\star$ can get very far away from the mode, leading to a very low acceptance rate and again high correlation in the Markov chain.

--

- Thus, good to implement several short runs of the algorithm varying $\delta$ and settle on one that yields acceptance rate in the range of 25-50%.

--

- Burn-in (and thinning) is even more important here!



---
## Metropolis in action

Back to our example with
.block[
$$
\begin{split}
\pi(\theta | y) \propto \text{exp}^{-\dfrac{1}{2}\theta^2} + \dfrac{1}{2} \text{exp}^{-\dfrac{1}{2}(\theta-3)^2}
\end{split}
$$
]

```{r, fig.height=4, echo=F}
x <- seq(from=-5,to=7,by=.05)
y <- (2/(3*sqrt(2*pi))) * (exp(-0.5*(x^2)) + 0.5*exp(-0.5*(x-3)^2))
plot(x,y,col="blue3",xlab=expression(theta),ylab="Density",
     main=expression(paste(pi,"(", theta,"|y)")))
```
