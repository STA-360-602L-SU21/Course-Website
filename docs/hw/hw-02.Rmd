## Instructions

Please make sure your final output file is a pdf document. You can submit handwritten solutions for non-programming exercises or type them using R Markdown, LaTeX or any other word processor. All programming exercises must be done in R, typed up clearly and with all code attached. Submissions should be made on gradescope: go to Assignments $\rightarrow$ Homework 2 (360) for students in STA 360 and Homework 2 (602) for students in STA 602.

## Questions

1. Let $$y_1,\ldots,y_n \overset{iid}{\sim} \textrm{Ga}(a,b)$$ where _a_ is known (so we only wish to infer _b_).
    + <font color="green">**Part (a):**</font> Find the conjugate family of priors for _b_.  
    <font color="blue">**(1 point for all students)**</font>
    + <font color="green">**Part (b):**</font> Find the corresponding posterior given the prior you identified in the previous part.  
    <font color="blue">**(1 point for all students)**</font>
    + <font color="green">**Part (c):**</font> Give an interpretation of the prior parameters as things like "prior mean", "prior variance", "prior sample size", etc.  
    <font color="blue">**(0.5 points for all students)**</font>

2. Hoff 3.3
    + <font color="blue">**Part (a): 1 point for all students**</font>
    + <font color="blue">**Part (b): 1 point for all students**</font>
    + <font color="blue">**Part (c): 1 point for all students**</font>

<!-- 4. Hoff 4.1 -->

<!-- 3. Hoff 4.3 -->

3. Hoff 4.8
    + <font color="blue">**Part (a): Students in STA 360: 1.5 points; Students in STA 602: 1 point**</font>
    + <font color="blue">**Part (b): Students in STA 360: 1.5 points; Students in STA 602: 1 point**</font>
    + <font color="blue">**Part (c): Students in STA 360: 1.5 points; Students in STA 602: 1 point**</font>
    + <font color="blue">**Part (d): Students in STA 360: 1.5 points; Students in STA 602: 1 point**</font>

    <font color="red">*You can find the data mentioned in the question here: http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~pdh10/FCBS/Exercises/. Clearly, you don't need to download and load the data, you can just enter it manually in R.* </font>
    
4. <font color="blue">**Jeffreys' prior distributions (From BDA3).**</font> Suppose $y|\theta \sim \textrm{Po}(\theta)$.
    + <font color="green">**Part (a):**</font> Find the Jeffreys' prior density for $\theta$. Recall that for single parameter models, the Jeffreys' prior is $\pi(\theta) \propto \sqrt{\mathcal{I}(\theta)}$, where $\mathcal{I}(\theta)$ is the Fisher information for $\theta$. Use one of the two definitions of Fisher information on the slides to find $\mathcal{I}(\theta)$, then set $\pi(\theta) \propto \sqrt{\mathcal{I}(\theta)}$.  
    <font color="blue">**(2 points for all students)**</font>

    + <font color="green">**Part (b):**</font> What values of $a$ and $b$ for the gamma density $\textrm{Ga}(a,b)$ will result in a close match to the Jeffreys' density you found?  
    <font color="blue">**(0.5 points for all students)**</font>
5. Suppose we have $n$ independent observations $Y = (y_1,y_2,\ldots,y_n)$, where each $y_i \sim \mathcal{N}(\theta, \sigma^2)$, and the parameters $\theta$ and $\sigma^2$ are unknown. Jeffreys' prior for $\theta$ and $\sigma^2$ (jointly) is $$\pi(\theta,\sigma^2) \propto (\sigma^2)^{-3/2}.$$ Derive the posterior under this prior and state whether it is proper. What happens when $n=1$ versus $n>1$?  
<font color="blue">**(2.5 points for all students)**</font>
    
    <font color="red">*You can either integrate directly to confirm it is proper (you probably shouldn't), or try to put it into a form of a distribution or combination of distributions you can try to recognize (just like we have been doing in class). Also, do this in terms of the variance not the precision, i.e., keep the normal likelihood in terms of the variance before combining it with the prior.* </font>
    
6. Hoff problem 5.2.  
<font color="blue">**(Students in STA 360: 3.5 points; Students in STA 602: 3 points)**</font>

7. <font color="green">**How many samples is enough?**</font> Recall the birth rates example from the slides.  
<font color="blue">**(Not graded for students in STA 360; you can attempt for practice but you don't need to submit. Graded for students in STA 602)**</font>
    + <font color="green">**Part (a):**</font> Sample from the posterior distribution for women who are college educated using $m$ = 10, 100, and 1000 Monte Carlo samples. For each $m$, make a plot of the random draws and on the same plot, mark the points corresponding to the posterior mean and the 95% equal-tailed credible interval (quantile-based). How do those compare to the true posterior mean and 95% quantile-based CI?  
    <font color="blue">**(1 point)**</font>
    
    +  <font color="green">**Part (b):**</font> In addition, calculate the posterior probability that $\theta_2 < 1.5$ in each case.  
    <font color="blue">**(0.5 points)**</font>
    
    + <font color="green">**Part (c):**</font> How large should $m$ be if $95\%$ of the time we want the difference between the Monte Carlo estimate of the posterior mean and the true posterior mean (which we know in this case) to be $\leq 0.001$?  
    <font color="blue">**(1 point)**</font>


## Grading
